# Solution to the 'Tree Traversals' challenges 
In this package are the 3 tree traversal challenges of HackerRank.

## Tree: Preorder Traversal.
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-preorder-traversal/problem
### Problem
Complete the preOrder function in your editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.
### Input Format
Our hidden tester code passes the root node of a binary tree to your preOrder function.
## Constraints
1<= Nodes in the tree <= 500 
### Output Format
Print the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.
### Sample Input
     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4  
## Sample Output
`1 2 5 3 4 6 `

## Tree: Postorder Traversal
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-postorder-traversal/problem
### Problem
Complete the postOrder function in your editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in the tree's postorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.
## Input Format
Our hidden tester code passes the root node of a binary tree to your postOrder function.
## Constraints
1 Nodes in the tree  500
## Output Format
Print the tree's postorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.
## Sample Input
     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4
## Sample Output
`4 3 6 5 2 1`
